**Trader Behaviour vs Market Sentiment – Data Science Project**

This project explores the connection between market sentiment (fear/greed) and trader activity.   
Using two datasets, I examined daily and account-level trading behaviour, carried out basic   
statistical comparisons, and trained a simple model to check if trader performance could be predicted.

**Contents**  
\- notebook\_1.ipynb – full workflow  
\- csv\_files/ – raw dataset files  
\- outputs/ – charts, metrics and model files  
\- ds\_report.pdf – final report

**Running the Notebook**  
1\. Open the notebook in Google Colab.  
2\. Mount Google Drive.  
3\. Make sure the folder path matches your Drive folder name.  
4\. Run the notebook in order.

**Notes**  
\- Daily dataset was too small for modelling, so account-day data was used.  
\- Plots and model outputs are saved in the outputs folder.
